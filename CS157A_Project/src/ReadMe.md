## **Project Overview:** 
We aim to create a system that would assist users in buying Books. The topic is a Bookstore system that will assist customers in identifying and searching for their desired book and placing an order for it.

## **Instructions for setting up and running the project:** 
All the needed drivers can be found in the github repo. To run the code, change the part after the ‘sqlite:’ in the url variable in the connect class of the DBMethods to the absolute file path of the database file. Then run the LoginPage class found in the GUI package to run the application.

## **Dependencies and required software**

The application requires drivers for SQLite and JBCrypt, however these drivers can be found in the repo. Also, the JavaFx SDK will be needed to run the GUI of the application.
